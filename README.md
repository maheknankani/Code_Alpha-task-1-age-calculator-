# AGE CALCULATOR

This HTML file creates an age calculator using JavaScript. The user selects their birth date, and the JavaScript function calculateAge computes the difference between the current date and the birth date in years, months, and days. The result is displayed in an element with the ID result. The maximum selectable date is set to today's date. The function getDaysInMonth helps calculate the correct number of days in each month. The logic accounts for different month lengths and adjusts the year and month differences as necessary to provide an accurate ageÂ calculation.
